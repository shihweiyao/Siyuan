				Considering the fact that most of the start-up businesses on campus are formed by students who are less likely to be viewed positively by corporations or venture capital at the early stages and therefore would possibly lose the chance to commercialize their own innovation or new technology, this Foundation worked to found the Seed Fund with funds collected from enthusiastic alumni. It offers support to business start-up teams in the expectation of more NCTU-based entrepreneurs in the future. Those supported and successful teams are required to reward the Seed Fund, in a bid to “pay it forward” and practice the spirit of “stay grateful.”
